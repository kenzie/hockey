= Player

Player class creates NHL player objects from NHL.com data. This is a first step in building a reliable hockey draft web application for the Annual Route 19 Draft.

== Examples

	brodeur = Player.find(8455710) # Fetch Martin Brodeur using his NHL.com ID
	puts brodeur.name # Martin Brodeur
	puts brodeur.birthplace # Montreal, QC, Canada
	puts brodeur.height # 6' 2"

== TODO

Need to add methods for finding a player by name as well as returning a player's stats, trends and status.
